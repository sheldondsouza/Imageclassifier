## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the image classification notebook on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x**: Recommended to use Python 3.8 or newer.
-   **pip**: Python package installer (comes with Python).
-   **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive execution of the `.ipynb` file.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sheldondsouza/Imageclassifier.git
    cd Imageclassifier
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    It's recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already present) with the following content:
    ```
    torch
    torchvision
    numpy
    matplotlib
    jupyter
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Ensure you install the correct `torch` version for your system, especially if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU. Refer to the [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for specific commands.*

4.  **Run Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook PyTorch.ipynb
    ```

5.  **Explore the Notebook**
    Your browser should open with the Jupyter Notebook interface. Click on `PyTorch.ipynb` to open it. You can run cells sequentially to execute the image classification workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All configuration parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and model architecture details, are defined directly within the `PyTorch.ipynb` notebook cells. You can easily modify these parameters to experiment with different training settings.

## üîë Core Concepts & Usage

The `PyTorch.ipynb` notebook walks through the following core concepts:

-   **Dataset Loading**: How to download and load a standard image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) using `torchvision.datasets`.
-   **Data Transformation**: Applying various `torchvision.transforms` for data augmentation (e.g., random crop, horizontal flip) and normalization.
-   **Dataloaders**: Setting up efficient data pipelines with `DataLoader` for batching and shuffling.
-   **Model Definition**: Constructing a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using `torch.nn.Module`.
-   **Loss Function & Optimizer**: Choosing appropriate loss functions (e.g., `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) and optimizers (e.g., `Adam`).
-   **Training Loop**: Implementing the forward and backward passes, parameter updates, and epoch-based training.
-   **Evaluation**: Calculating accuracy and loss on a separate validation/test set to monitor model performance.
-   **Prediction**: Using the trained model to classify new images.

To use the notebook:
1.  Open `PyTorch.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.
2.  Read through the explanations and code cells.
3.  Execute each cell in order to run the entire workflow.
4.  Feel free to modify parameters or experiment with different model configurations directly within the cells.
