A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook implementation for building and training an image classification model using PyTorch.

üìñ Overview
This repository presents a practical guide and executable code for developing an image classification model. Leveraging the power of PyTorch, this project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model definition, training, evaluation, and inference. It‚Äôs designed to be an accessible starting point for machine learning enthusiasts and practitioners looking to dive into deep learning for computer vision tasks.

‚ú® Features
Efficient Data Loading: Demonstrates how to load and prepare image datasets using torchvision.datasets and DataLoader.
Custom Data Transforms: Includes examples of common data augmentations and preprocessing techniques with torchvision.transforms.
Neural Network Architecture: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model suitable for image classification.
Model Training Loop: Provides a clear and configurable training loop with loss calculation and optimizer updates.
Performance Evaluation: Tracks and reports model accuracy and loss during training and on a test set.
Inference & Prediction: Shows how to use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images.
Jupyter Notebook Interface: All code is encapsulated within an interactive Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and visualization.

üöÄ Quick Start
Follow these steps to set up and run the image classification notebook on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Recommended to use Python 3.8 or newer.
pip: Python package installer (comes with Python).
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive execution of the .ipynb file.
Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/sheldondsouza/Imageclassifier.git
cd Imageclassifier
Create a virtual environment (recommended)

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies
It‚Äôs recommended to create a requirements.txt file (if not already present) with the following content:

torch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib
jupyter
Then install them:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure you install the correct torch version for your system, especially if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU. Refer to the PyTorch installation page for specific commands.

Run Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook PyTorch.ipynb
Explore the Notebook
Your browser should open with the Jupyter Notebook interface. Click on PyTorch.ipynb to open it. You can run cells sequentially to execute the image classification workflow.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
All configuration parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and model architecture details, are defined directly within the PyTorch.ipynb notebook cells. You can easily modify these parameters to experiment with different training settings.

üîë Core Concepts & Usage
The PyTorch.ipynb notebook walks through the following core concepts:

Dataset Loading: How to download and load a standard image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) using torchvision.datasets.
Data Transformation: Applying various torchvision.transforms for data augmentation (e.g., random crop, horizontal flip) and normalization.
Dataloaders: Setting up efficient data pipelines with DataLoader for batching and shuffling.
Model Definition: Constructing a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using torch.nn.Module.
Loss Function & Optimizer: Choosing appropriate loss functions (e.g., nn.CrossEntropyLoss) and optimizers (e.g., Adam).
Training Loop: Implementing the forward and backward passes, parameter updates, and epoch-based training.
Evaluation: Calculating accuracy and loss on a separate validation/test set to monitor model performance.
Prediction: Using the trained model to classify new images.
To use the notebook:

Open PyTorch.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.
Read through the explanations and code cells.
Execute each cell in order to run the entire workflow.
Feel free to modify parameters or experiment with different model configurations directly within the cells.
